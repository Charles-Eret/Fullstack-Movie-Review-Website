# Fullstack-Movie-Review-Website
Developed a full-stack web application for movie reviews utilizing modern technologies. Designed the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with dynamic rendering of movie cards and review pages. Designed the back-end using Node.js and Express.js for handling CRUD operations on movie reviews, utilizing MongoDB
as the database to manage movie review data. Implemented RESTful APIs to retrieve movie information and movie review data, incorporating asynchronous JavaScript
(AJAX) on the front-end. 
Users can search for movies and view detailed information including posters and titles. Users can add, edit, and delete their reviews for movies. Real-time updates ensure that reviews are immediately reflected on the website after modification. Intuitive user interfaces facilitate easy interaction with the website, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
